# Generators

remdn uses an extendable system of generators that are responsible to maintain each `<-- remdn:name -->` section.

There are several available generators for remdn each supporting different arguments.

See next sections for available generators and [open issues](https://github.com/reliverse/remdn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agenerator) for proposed generators and feel free to suggest any generator ideas to be included!
