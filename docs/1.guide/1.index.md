# Getting Started

remdn scans for the annotation comments within the markdown document and updates their contents using built-in generators.

The syntax is like this:

    <!-- remdn:generator [...args] -->
    <!-- /remdn -->

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in the early stages and under development.

## Using CLI

The easiest way to use remdn is to use the CLI. You can install remdn and add it to the `build` or `release` command in `package.json` or directly run `npx remdn` in your project.

```sh
npx remdn@latest
```

By default, the `README.md` file in the current working directory will be used as the target.

You can use `--dir` and `--input` arguments to customize the default behavior to operate on any other markdown file.
